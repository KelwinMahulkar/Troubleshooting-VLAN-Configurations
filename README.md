# Troubleshooting-VLAN-Configurations

In this project activity VLAN configurations are the same as in the previous repository but there are a few diffeences though. There are some configurations such as VLAN names and ports assigned to it, which are configured incorrectly. Due to these wrong configurations the vlans will not work properly and therefore need troubleshooting. With the help of ping commands connectivity tests are held which help in showing whether the problem is solved or not. In addition to this, show commands also have a vital role. 

The topology is the same as the previous project. A document file has been uploaded which has all the documented work which includes results of different commands issued.
